# vuechit

## NOT READY FOR PUBLIC USE

Seriously. And it probably never will be because this is more of a "learning Vue" thing than
a serious attempt at a project.

## Project setup

```
npm install
```

### Compiles and minifies for production

```
npm run build
```

And then you have to do some not yet documented weird stuff to get it in to your mafia folder.
Also you need to have `relay_testchit.js` in your relay folder.
